## Project Tasks

This project was developed incrementally through a series of tasks:

1. **Initial Setup**: Provided initial source code from the course owner.
2. **Minimum Execution Quantity**: Added functionality to support orders with a minimum execution quantity.
3. **Stop Limit Orders**: Implemented stop limit orders.
4. **Code Refactoring (Clean Code)**: Refactored the code to improve readability and maintainability.
5. **Auction Mode**: Added auction mode to the matching engine.
6. **Final Refactoring**: Comprehensive code refactor to address design issues and code smells.

## Code Quality

Throughout the project, we emphasized code quality and clean coding practices. Key refactoring efforts included:

- Improving variable and method naming
- Breaking down large methods into smaller, more manageable functions
- Reducing code duplication
- Enhancing modularity and separation of concerns
- Implementing unit tests to ensure code reliability
